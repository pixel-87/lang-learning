# fizzbuzz

Challenge: 04-fizzbuzz
Chapter: 07-loops

Go suppots the standard [modulo operator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVNaZntwYPw):

`7 % 3 // 1`

The AND [logical operator](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Logical_operators):

```go
true && false // false
true && true // true
```

As well as the OR operator:
```go
true || false // true
false || false // false
```

## Assignment

We're hiring at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game, a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the `fizzbuzz` function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line, but replace multiples of 3 with the text `fizz` and multiples of 5 with `buzz`. Print `fizzbuzz` for multiples of 3 AND 5.

> [!WARNING]
> This lesson is graded based on the output of your program, so don't leave any debugging print statements in your code.

## Tip

Example output:

```
